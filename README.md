## React from scratch

Some experiment on running a minimal example of React working with Babel 6 and webpack

## Installation

Just `git clone` & `npm install`:

```
git clone https://github.com/2slow/react-from-scratch.git
cd react-from-scratch
npm install
```

## Then use it with one more

Run the dev server:

```
npm start
```

And open the url localhost:3006 (because :8080 is too mainstream)
